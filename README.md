# Book_Recommendation_System

The **Book Recommendation System** is a data-driven project that provides personalized book suggestions based on user preferences and reading history. It uses collaborative filtering techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to analyze user ratings and generate accurate recommendations. The system leverages Python and libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and Scikit-learn for machine learning. Interactive analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, with datasets containing user ratings and metadata. This project showcases expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and recommendation algorithms, offering a practical solution for enhancing user engagement in the domain of book discovery.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Notebooks such as `50accurate.ipynb`, `Report.ipynb`, and `SVD.ipynb` likely contain data analysis, model development, and evaluation processes.

- **Datasets**: Files like `Ratings.csv` and `Users.csv` are included, presumably containing user ratings and information essential for building the recommendation system.

**Skills and Technologies Employed**:

- **Programming Languages**: Python

- **Data Analysis and Manipulation**: Utilized libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling.

- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Implemented algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for collaborative filtering to generate accurate recommendations.

- **Development Environment**: Leveraged Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and analysis.
